# NotePadFromScratch
implementing concepts of java file handling by creating a custom notepadd APP using the classes in java used for handling files

What i developed ?
A lightweight Java console-based Notepad application that lets users:

Write and save notes
View existing notes
Clear content of notes
Backup notes (create a copy)

Store all .txt files in an organized notes/ directory

📂 Folder Structure
.
├── notes/              # All note files stored here
├── src/
│   └── apps/
│       └── NotePadCustom/
│           └── MiniNotePad.java
├── README.md


** Features**

👀 View Notes: Read contents of saved notes.
🧹 Clear Notes: Wipe all content in a selected note.
📁 Backup Notes: Create a copy of any note (prefixed with copy).
📌 Smart File Checks: Checks if a note already exists before writing or clearing.
